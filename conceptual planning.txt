Brainstorming / table ideas
	things that we need to keep track of for this app
		• db that keeps track of users
			this database will store data about the users
			 - user id
			 - email
			 - password
			 - username
		
		• db that keeps track of food
			when adding items to 'grocery list', the app will pull from this list of items
			 - id of food
			 - name
			 - price			
		
		• db that keeps track of recipes
			 - user id REFERENCE user db
			 - id of foods REFERENCE food db


		• db that keeps track of occasions

		• db that keeps track of grocery lists
			 - user id REFERENCE user db
